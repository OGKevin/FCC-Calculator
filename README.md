## FCC Calculator

As described on [FCC](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-javascript-calculator) website the user should be able to:

* Add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
* Clear the input field with a clear button.
* Keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.
